# VisualVoice_DeepLearning
The project showcases how to integrate deep learning for real-world tasks such as image recognition and speech-to-text conversion.

## **Project Description**
This project demonstrates the use of **deep learning models** for two key applications:
1. **Image Recognition**: Classifying an image using a pre-trained deep learning model.
2. **Speech Conversion**: Converting the classification result into audible speech.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Image Recognition**
- Utilizes a **pre-trained ResNet50 model** from TensorFlow.
- Demonstrates loading and preprocessing of an image for classification.
- Classifies the image accurately; for example, the model identified an image of a pizza and predicted the label as **"pizza."**
- Decodes the model's output and displays the predicted label for the image.

### **2. Speech-to-Text Conversion**
- Converts the predicted image label ("pizza") into speech using the **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** library.
- Generates an audio file that speaks the label in a natural voice.
- Example output: The audio file plays, saying, **"This is a pizza."**

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to:
1. Showcase the power of pre-trained **deep learning models** for image recognition tasks.
2. Demonstrate the integration of text-to-speech (TTS) technology for enhanced user interaction.

## **Key Highlights**
- **Image Recognition**:
  - Uses the **ResNet50** model, which is known for its state-of-the-art image classification capabilities.
  - Demonstrates the ease of utilizing pre-trained models in TensorFlow for real-world tasks.

- **Speech Conversion**:
  - Combines image recognition with text-to-speech conversion to provide a complete, interactive demo.
  - Generates clear and natural-sounding audio outputs using the gTTS library.

## **How to Use**
1. Load an image into the script.
2. The ResNet50 model will classify the image and predict a label.
3. The predicted label will be converted into audible speech using gTTS.

---

## **Example Output**
1. **Input Image:** An image of a pizza.
2. **Model Prediction:** "pizza."
3. **Speech Output:** An audio file saying, **"This is a pizza."**
